This TypeScript code demonstrates a common type error. The `printCoord` function expects an object with numeric `x` and `y` properties. However, if you were to try to use this code with string values in the object, it would result in a type error because TypeScript enforces type checking at compile time.  The solution shows how to fix this by either explicitly typing the object as {x: string; y: string} or changing the function to accept strings.  This is a basic but essential illustration of TypeScript's type safety.
